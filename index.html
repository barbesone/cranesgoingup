            <p>There are lots of new projects going up around the city that will change the urban environment for decades to come. Right here on Staten Island 
            are some significant developments along the North Shore. Downtown Brooklyn is also the location for important projects, and, of course, Manhattan 
            has a fare share of new construction sites as well.</p>
